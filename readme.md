Hello!

This chrome extension blocks ads from youtube videos by blocking requests sent from your browser to common advertising servers. If, while using this extension, you come across an ad on youtube, don't worry! Take note of the URL of the ad, and add it to the list of default filters in the background.js file. Save and update the extension, and all should be well :)

Thanks, and enjoy CCB AdBlocker!
